# Description
    - This project was created to build a better understanding of NoSQL and why it has a purpose compared to using SQL.This was created using MongoDB.
    - This project was created to build a platform that would take in the users, thoughts and reactions to the thoughts. Also created a data system that would show relationships of friends between users.
    - The Mongo DB creates a database that does not need to join tables and necessary relationships.
    - Mongo DB still needs routes and models but it is not as strict as SQL in seeding and creating tables.
